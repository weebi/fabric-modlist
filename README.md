# Fabric modlists

*"Weebi's good enough lists for mods."* - eemu

This repository is intended to be a collection of Fabric mod lists to improve the gameplay experience on both servers and clients.

## Why?

> *Many different modlists for fabric already exist. Why did you make another one?*

*"The others sucked lmao."* - One of the contributors

We'd been talking for a long time about compiling a collection of lists where we can add all the mods that spark interest in us.

## Categories

Client- and serverside mods are divided into their own lists for the sake of convenience. There's also a list dedicated for QoL modpacks.

- [Clientside](lists/Clientside.md)

- [Modpacks](lists/Modpacks.md)

- [Serverside](lists/Serverside.md)
